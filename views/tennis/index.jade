                | NEW SUNDAY WOMEN’S ALTA TEAM IN HIGHLAND POINTE
                | We are excited to announce that there is a new beginner Sunday Women’s ALTA Team in Highland 
                | Pointe. Michelle Vientos has graciously agreed to coordinate the formation of this new team, as 
                | well as captain it for the fall season. Thank-you, Michelle! Since ALTA allows women to play on 
                | Sunday and Thursday teams during the same season, it is hopeful that we will soon recruit a few 
                | more players for a lower level Thursday team as well. Highland Pointe has four courts, so the 
                | neighborhood is allowed to have as many as four Thursday Women’s teams, four Men’s teams, 
                | and four Sunday Women’s teams. If anyone would like to coordinate and/or captain an additional 
                | Women’s or Men’s team for the neighborhood, please email 
                a(href='mailto:tennis@highlandpointe.org') tennis@highlandpointe.org
                | for guidelines and Highland Pointe Tennis rules.
